Conway's Game of Life

Introduction
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. The Game of Life consists of a grid of cells that can be either alive or dead. Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).
These simple rules can lead to surprisingly complex and varied behavior, including patterns that remain stable, oscillate, or even produce moving structures. Conway's Game of Life has fascinated scientists, mathematicians, and hobbyists for decades and is a classic example of emergent behavior.

Project Description
This implementation of Conway's Game of Life is built using Python and the PyGame library. It provides an interactive graphical interface where users can create their initial configuration of live cells and watch how they evolve over time according to the rules of the game. The program offers various features to enhance user interaction and customization.

Features
